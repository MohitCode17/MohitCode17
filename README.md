# Hi 👋, I'm Mohit Gupta

### Backend-Oriented Full-Stack Developer | GenAI Engineer | Systems-Focused Builder

I'm a **self-taught software developer** based in **Delhi, India**, with a strong focus on **Backend GenAI engineering**, **clean UI/UX**, and **modern JavaScript ecosystems**.

I started my tech journey in **2022** from a **non-technical background** and gradually transitioned into full‑stack development by building real-world projects instead of just following tutorials. Today, I enjoy designing scalable interfaces, building backend systems, and experimenting with **AI-powered applications**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

* Design and build **scalable backend systems** using Node.js & Express
* Architect **REST APIs, authentication flows, and data models**
* Work with **databases (MongoDB) and system-level backend concepts**
* Build **GenAI-powered backends** (RAG pipelines, agent orchestration)
* Connect backend systems with clean, efficient frontend interfaces

---

## 🔭 Currently Working On

* 🧱 **Backend engineering depth** (Node.js internals, async model, scalability)
* 🧠 **System design fundamentals** (APIs, services, data flow)
* 🤖 **Generative AI backends** (RAG, multi-agent systems, AI orchestration)
* 📊 **DSA & problem-solving** with backend interview focus

## 🌱 My Learning Philosophy

> I think in systems, not screens.

While I started with frontend development, my long-term focus is on **backend engineering and AI-powered systems**. I enjoy understanding *how things work under the hood* — async execution, request lifecycles, data flow, and system behavior.

I prefer building **end-to-end backend logic** that scales and integrates cleanly with AI and frontend layers.
